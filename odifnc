The fact this comes with a Snapdragon 865+ is stunning and unprecedented. That's the one used in rare Taiwanese gaming phones! 
This phone is one of the only ways to get one of those easily.
Performance is, obviously, amazing, and the screen is so sharp and clear. The Android experience is great, 
I love Samsung's UI especially when you use it with the official Samsung App "Good Lock" in the Samsung App Store, 
which unlocks all the multitasking features and others.
You can see in my photo that I have a game running, a chat going, and a full screen keyboard on one half of the device (SwiftKey). 
Also it's easy to set apps to pop up in little floating windows so that you can read your notification in the app itself, tap the Close symbol, 
and move on with your day. That's so much better than having to entirely change what's on your screen.
