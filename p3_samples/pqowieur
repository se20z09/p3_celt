This game is Persona 5. It's everything you loved about it, all the stories, all the people, the wonderful story crafting, and more. The game is basically their final version of the game, with all the additives you could honestly want it what was already a very massive game.

Persona 5 took on average about 70-90 hours to complete everything, and this game adds about 30 more hours on that. It gives you all the previous DLC for FREE... yes, completely free. And all the new DLC is cosmetic or some battle items. So no missing out on the story or chunks of game here

This is the definitive edition of an already great game. You will fall into it's story, it's characters, and it's ups and downs all over again, or for the first time. The new character shows up early and remains prevalent, with the addition of new substories and plots. Even a new entire Palace! A whole new dungeon, even when they added more to the other palaces, like Will Seeds and even a new movement feature, attack move, and ammo replenishment. They didn't just add of all it in either, they made it story prevalent. They wrote new dialogues for this and more.
