We booked this hotel because my stepdaughter flies out of RDU at 6am and we live all the way in Wilmington. 
Instead of driving up to RDU at 1am with a 10 year old and a 4 month old, we decided to stay the night before in a hotel. 
We chose this hotel based on the high reviews and stunning room photos. We were very excited for our visit.
Unfortunately we had a less than satisfactory experience. We stayed in room 109. Upon arrival we walked in and was almost knocked over by the smell of mold and mildew. 
The smell was so bad my husband felt sick all night. I didnt complain to the front desk because they were full, we had arrived very late and just wanted to get to bed so we could get up early in the morning. 
There was a dirty towel left in the bathtub from the previous visitors and there were no sheets in the pull out bed (even though the pull out bed had a tag on it that said the sheets would be folded up in the bed). 
When we called the front desk to request sheets, they had us walk to them rather sending someone to deliver them to our room.
The hotel did have a wonderful breakfast. That was about the only good side to the entire visit.
We are not the type to knit pick and complain about everything (which is why I didn't go to the front desk and request other accommodations or a refund). 
I just wanted to post here in hopes that management in the hotel will identify this issue and fix it before it deters other guests
