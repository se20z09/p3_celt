You think I hate you? I don't hate you. This job is eating me alive, I can't breathe anymore, 
and if I come out this guy Lefty dies. They're gonna kill him because he vouched for me because 
he stood up for me I live with that every day. That's the same thing as if I put the bullet in 
his head myself, you understand? I spent all these years being the good guy, you know the man 
in the white fucking hat, for what? For nothing. I'm not becoming like them Maggie, I am them.
