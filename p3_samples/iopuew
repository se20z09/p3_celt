Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing!

This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, 
then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, 
then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine.

If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. 
I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's 
(if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its 
grounds when using other programs.
