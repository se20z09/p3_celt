This, really, really, sucked. All I got was 3 copies of John Wick 2 in the same box. A good John Wick? 
Yes. I liked it and it’s a fantastic movie. In fact, it’s 1/3 of one of my favorite movie trilogies. 
And that’s what I hoped to purchase. A trilogy. Instead, I got the same film- again, a good film- 3 
times. And while I’m annoyed. I’m equally perplexed. I have racked my brain, trying to figure out where 
they got a single box of John Wick 2 holding 3 copies of ONLY John Wick 2. Like what kind of criminal 
mastermind is this? Who are they deceiving? I want a refund, or replacements for 2 copies of John Wick 2,
in the form of 1 copy each of John Wick and John Wick: Parabellim, or I want the answers to my previous 
questions out of sheer curiousity.
