Overall, the fact that the Prototype Biohazard Bundle is so poorly named and that it was 
snuck on to the market without so much as an acknowledgement it was there should be all 
the warning you need. But allow me to reiterate the obvious; they didnâ€™t bother to graphically 
update an outdated game nor did they try to clean up the messy controls.
