I don't know what to say really.
Three minutes to the biggest battle of our professional lives, it all comes down to today.
Either we heal as a team or we are going to crumble.
Inch by inch, play by play, 'till we're finished.
We are in hell right now, gentlemen. Believe me. And we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light.
We can climb out of hell. One inch at a time.
On this team, we fight for that inch.
On this team, we tear ourselves, and everyone around us to pieces for that inch.
We CLAW with our finger nails for that inch.
Cause we know when we add up all those inches that's going to make the fucking difference between WINNING and LOSING, between LIVING and DYING.
