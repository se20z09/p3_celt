For one, Apple's smallest new iPhone is just as fast as its big brother thanks to that A14 Bionic chipset. 
I could rehash out how Apple's shift to 5nm chips gave it the transistor budget needed to significantly boost its processors' performance, but it’s not really necessary. 
Long story short, the iPhone 12 mini is lightning-fast, whether you're playing resource-intensive games or bouncing between multiple apps. 

The fact that the 12 mini is just as powerful as the iPhone 12 might not seem remarkable, but it's fascinating when you consider it in a larger context. 
When companies design small smartphones, they generally don't use the very best chipset available; the most recent exception was Sony's Xperia XZ2 Compact, which squeezed that year's flagship Snapdragon 845 into a 5-inch device. 
More recently, we've seen powerful (but still slightly downmarket) chipsets like the Snapdragon 765 used in devices like the Pixel 5. 
While they're more than fast enough for daily use, they lack the sheer performance you’ll get with more premium silicon.
