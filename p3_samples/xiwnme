Fiction can be fun, but I find the reference section a little more enlightening. For 
instance, if you were to look up the NFL's "All Time Bonehead Plays," you might read
about a Miami Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle, who missed the 26 yard field goal in 
the closing seconds of Super Bowl XVII.
What you wouldn't read about was how Ray Finkle lost his mind was committed to a 
mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity 
of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even 
with Dan Marino for whom he blamed the entire thing!
SHE'S NOT LOIS EINHORN!, she's Ray Finkle, she's a man.
