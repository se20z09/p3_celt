Don't go! The mussles were rubbery, the scallops were hard and overcooked, and the linguini was inedible and coated in hot sauce (I like heat, but this was all heat and no flavor). The worst, part, however, was that we waited 60 minutes for just an appetizer of French fries (which was the only good part of the meal) and 90 minutes for the entries. I think our waitress simply forgot to put in our order. I remember when this place was Martine's, many years ago. what a shame. It was either an "off" day or these others were paid Yelp reviews. but, what we experienced was an establishment ready for kitchen nightmares. Since we couldn't eat what we ordered, I'm going to take my family home and feed them now. Sigh.
