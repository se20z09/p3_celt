 I always buy size 11 shoes. Yet after buying these and shipping to the other end of the world, I found them to be extremely 
 uncomfortable to the stage where I cannot even bare the thought about wearing them after trying to break in for a week or so. 
 They fit bigger than usual, the middle part causes a lot of pain in my right foot, the fabric causes tension sideways, and overall 
 I feel very uncomfortable while wearing these otherwise beautiful shoes. I hope I could return them, but it's too far away already, 
 and I got them at a time, when sending them back is not an option in terms of dates. It's a pity, since those were recommended by a
 podiatrist as being the most comfortable brand.
