Solas is the worst establishment I have ever dealt with! They are unprofessional. 
We had a party booked there for a Saturday night and they told me last minute that had to get us out in 2 hrs because they booked another party for that room the same night!! 
They did not care and did not think twice about it. How can have 30 people in and out for dinner in 2 hours?? 
I will never, never go back there again. There are so many other great restaurants in Raleigh other than Solas! I wish i could give it zero stars. That's even too much for them!
