The sun did not shine. It was too wet to play. So we sat int he house all that cold, cold, wet day. I sat there with Sally. We sat there, we two. And I said "How I wish we had something to do!" Too wet to go out and too cold to play ball. So we sat in the house and did nothing at all. So all we could do was to sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! And we did not like it. Not one little bit. And then something went BUMP! How that bump made us jump! We looked! Then we saw him step in on the mat! We looked! And we saw him! The Cat in the Hat! And he said to us, "Why do you sit there like that?"
