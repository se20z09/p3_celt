Joyously Surprised!!! 
I heard voices and horns, and looked out the window to see about 50 wonderful people walking down New Bern Avenue picking up trash. 
One lady was even pregnant. This is an awesome news story that will never get enough coverage. I love my city!!!
Does anyone know which group this is? They deserve some praise and Thanks!
New Bern Ave gets a lot of trash from rude people that drive through from other areas. 
Myself and other neighbors have to pickup some trash from time to time. 
But we can't do it all. Let's keep Raleigh clean!
