New York City is a fantastic setting to step into the world of next-gen gaming, with smooth, 
consistent frame rates and the mind-blowing ray-tracing capabilities to carry Spider-Man into 
the future. With Insomniac Games likely planning DLC to extend the campaign, Miles Morales is 
a brilliant follow-up to a fantastic PlayStation-exclusive franchise that will likely tempt 
over many gamers on the fence to buy the PS5, just so they can experience this wondrous story.
