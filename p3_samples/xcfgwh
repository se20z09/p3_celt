Animal Crossing has always been pretty repetitive game in my eyes - I've been playing them consistently since Wild World. 
I do agree that the dialogue in New Horizons lacks a bit of depth, but that has been the case for at least the past two iterations.
To me it's a game that is repetitive by nature, at least the way I play it! 
Every time I play I will go around and dig up fossils, harvest fruit, fish, catch bugs, etc to get bells for various things - upgrading my house, buying furniture, paying off loans, etc.
I'm at 150 hours played now and will admit that I started to get bored with it at around the 120 hour mark, but started focusing more on catching all the fish/insects/sea creatures as well as the nook mile challenges.
