"You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. And one night, 
he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy grabs the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't 
like that. Not. One. Bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does 
it. He turns to me and says, 'Why so serious?' He comes at me with the knife. 'Why so serious?' 
Sticks the blade in my mouth. 'Let's put a smile on that face!'"
