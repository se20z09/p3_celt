The battles are howlingly inept. Brave but raggedy villagers line up against their aggressors as if they're being choreographed by blind people. Gouts of water and bolts of fire fly around the screen but hit their targets off screen. (Perhaps it's the 3D.) Black-uniformed armies sweatily duke it out with other armies in an attempt to recreate the Helm's Deep battle from The Lord of the Rings, but to little effect. The plot disappears from trace for long periods, or suddenly hinges on some teeny detail – as when the earthly representative of the Moon Spirit turns out to be a koi carp in a pond. And I'm sorry to say that every portentous mention of the word "bend" and its derivatives ("From the first time that we knew you were a bender ...") reduced grown-up critics to sniggering 11-year-olds.

It's the sole moment of humour or entertainment in this breathtakingly clueless, misconceived, stupid, humourless, unexciting, dim, dumb farrago, the worst film I've seen in years. It makes Clash of the Titans look like Götterdämmerung.
