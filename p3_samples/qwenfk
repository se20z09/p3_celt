After over 60+ hours of playing Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, I was surprised by how well it was able to innovate while bringing back classic elements, like social stealth and settlement development. 
I wish there was a bit more sneaky-sneaky action here, but was glad to at least see an increase from recent games. 
Valhalla also does a good job portraying the Vikings as deadly invaders and lost settlers looking for a new life.

The changes Valhalla brings to the franchise feel as great as a warm hearthfire during a cold winter night. 
The game’s developers have crafted a world that is wonderful to explore, that soaked up hours and hours of my day before I noticed It. 
The changes to how the game handles loot and questing, for example, make it a nicer experience to play. 
Overall, it feels a lot of care and thought went into making Valahalla feel less like a checklist of things to do and more like a world to organically experience.

This might not be what longtime fans who miss the more stealth-oriented games wanted, but for those looking for a big, open-world that isn’t boring, there aren’t much better than Valhalla.
