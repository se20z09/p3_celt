Will, she's been dead two years and that's the shit I remember. Wonderful stuff, you know, 
little things like that. Ah, but, those are the things I miss the most. The little 
idiosyncrasies that only I knew about. That's what made her my wife. Oh, and she had the 
goods on me, too; she knew all my little peccadillos. People call these things imperfections, 
but they're not â€” aw that's the good stuff. And then we get to choose who we let into our 
weird little worlds. You're not perfect, sport. And let me save you the suspense. This girl 
you met, she isn't perfect either. But the question is: whether or not you're perfect for 
each other. That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about. Now you can know 
everything in the world, sport, but the only way you're findin' out that one is by givin' 
it a shot.
