I’m sure some of you have noticed the tear down of the house and trees on Sasser St.  
Well construction has begun and I’m having trouble with damage being done to my property. 
After many conversations with the property owner and the builder and receiving many promises from 
both that they would be careful to not damage my trees and property, 
I came home today to find that they had spent the day driving through my yard and over tree roots with heavy equipment. 
They used that equipment to move (and destroy) boulders placed to stop that from happening. 
They came into my yard and moved things that were on my property marking the boundary line so they could get their equipment in. 
I am so upset. I understand that construction is difficult but is it too much to ask that they not come onto my property and destroy it? 
Any advice on how to get it to stop? I won’t know for at least a year if my trees will survive. 
I’ve added a photo that shows some of the damage. 
The property line is 5 feet from the new foundation.
