I try to give products a fair review. I have to say that I was immensely underwhelmed by this product. 
For the price I was expecting something a little bigger. The dimensions posted are not accurate. As 
someone else said, they are for the box itself. The packaging was horrible. It came in an envelope 
and the box was bent and deformed in shipping. You would think greater care would be given to a product 
that costs this much and has potential to be a collector's item. The animatronics are decent, quality 
of the product is not bad. The skin does feel soft and it does respond. I am still trying to figure 
out the 25+ sounds. Wondering if they just mean the syllables uttered in a cooing sentence of his, 
because there seem to be only three real reactions. I am still unsure if I will return this or exchange 
it for one with better packaging.
