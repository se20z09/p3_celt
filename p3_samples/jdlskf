After reading a few reviews I was perfectly prepared to embrace a few duds and setup casualties with these hangers. After all, what can you expect 
at $33.99 for 100 hangers, right? That's more than half the price of any other hangers out there.
Well, 300+ hangers later, they are all happily dangling in my closet, making it look pretty :)
The heads do swivel, yay. As a few reviews mentioned, you have to give them a firm twist, they'll make a snapping sound, and swivel from then on effortlessly.
They are skinny and lightweight, freeing up a ton of space in your closet. I was a little concerned about the flimsy feel, but they don't act flimsy at all. 
The hangers are holding up heavy jackets just fine. I did put two hangers inside the heaviest 
full-length men's winter coat just in case (my hubby's idea actually), so that's an option if you've got something extra heavy.
I got the ivory/beige ones and have seen zero shedding on my black tops.
All in all, I have zero complains. At this price-point I was willing to give them 5 stars even with a few duds so long as they did their job right. 
The fact that they were all 100% flawless leaves me wishing they had 6 stars. Impressive job Amazon!
