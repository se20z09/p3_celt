Hot Dog Cart - Huge Thanks! (Part 2). 
Just when you think things can't get any better for your business -- THEY DO! 
The story about our canopy being blown away by Thursday's winds, then being recovered by a great customer is getting a lot of attention. 
But it gets better!

We also lost our 12' tall bright yellow Hot Dog flag in the high winds. 
We figured that it was either in a tree, or had been blown away to parts unknown. 
Any loss, especially to a small business hurts, but it could have been worse. 
Upon returning to our location after we closed yesterday, what do we find but our flag, folded and neatly draped over something. 

What we had chaulked up as a loss will be happily waving in the breeze today thanks to yet another good honest person doing a good thing. 
It sure is great to live and own a business in an area like ours. 
Thanks again to all for your continuing support, and a big shout out to the good folks that  recovered and returned the wind blown things to us!!!

All of this good karma will certainly help to cancel some of the negativity we have been living with! :-)
