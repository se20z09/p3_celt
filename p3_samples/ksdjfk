After five years the ear pads and the head band get porous - means after each use of the phones you have small black parts in your hair and on your cloth. 
Tried 3 times to get in touch with the support in Europe and also one directly in the US. Only after contacting them via Facebook I got an answer. 
You can change the ear pads but not the head band. Support told me to buy a new headphone from Bose (they made a special, special offer which was nearly 
the same amount in total like you can buy a new one via amazon). The headphone was designed with no possibility to change the wearing. And they also used 
a very poor material for the headband. They asked me again (I told them before) for the serial one week ago - since then - NO answer, NO reaction after 
trying to contact them again (they promise on their website to react within 24 hours - if you google "bose and support" you'll find a lot of complaints about their support). 
Nearly each mail I got was signed by a different person, Next time, I'll will look for a company with better support!!!
