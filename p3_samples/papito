We were a party of 8 on New Years Eve. I was concerned about the noise level, would the kitchen be overwhelmed, would service be up to par. 
My concerns were merely wasted energy. We easily carried on conversations, the food arrived in a very timely manner and was perfect temperature, 
but the highlight of the evening was the service. It was impeccable. Kelly was our main server and David was our beverage server. 
If any of us had a question, a special request, or a substitution Kelly would answer ABSOLUTELY without hesitation. Better than that, 
it wasn’t just an offhanded answer. She came through every time. David was there to keep us quenched and bar orders filled. 
By no means were they overshadowing but somehow made an appearance at the right moment. Rey himself stopped by the table several times during 
the course of the night to make sure we were content and pleased. It was a fabulous end to the year but overall, service was probably the best I’ve experienced.
