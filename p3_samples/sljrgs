First things first, this bat is not great as advertised. At least according to me. The bat has better control, but not so much for the price difference. 
I totally don't get the steep attack part which is advertised, its smashes were less powerful and less attacking than my cheaper bat. All in all, the bat 
did not serve its purpose and adding to insult was that it got severely damaged while playing doubles during a bat clash
Seller Review:
Was very disappointed with the seller. Ordered a 4U G4 bat and got a 3U G5 bat. Originally this bat was supposed to be unstrung, but mine came with BG65 strung on it. 
Also the sticker was already scratched and the code was visible (though when checked in sunrise website the product was authentic). I contacted the seller and asked about all these inconsistencies
His reply was, this bat was ordered by another customer in his shop with BG65 and last minute he changed his mind and went with another bat. So guess what, 
the seller decided to give it to me instead, though it was not the bat i ordered. I was furious and asked him about this. His reply was sorry sir, 
and agreed to replace it (though by that time I had opened the bat and the sticker, I could not send it back)
So in summary, very disappointed with the product and the seller. Take your own risks if you want to buy here !!!
