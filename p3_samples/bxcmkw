I am on the fence about this vacuum. I think if you don't have a lot of time and a family, this would be great. For me I think its a bit overkill.
It was nearly ready to go out of the box. I only had to charge it for an hour and then tried it out. I did have some difficulty getting it to recognize 
my router. It took about 10 tries before it connected. Once it located the wi fi, I started it up and let it do it's thing. It runs very smoothly and is 
able to turn in all directions. It started out in neat little rows back and forth but I noticed that it doesn't get along baseboards very well, due to 
the round shape of the vacuum. I will have to use my regular Dyson to vacuum along the baseboards to get up pet hair and dust. I have a small house with 
a lot of furniture, piles of books next to my bookcases and cat trees. The iRoomba was doing its best to get around everything. As far as I could tell, 
it did no mapping because it wandered haphazardly from the living dining room to kitchen and back. It was relatively quiet except for the chihuahua's who 
were sure it was some kind of alien invasion and kept barking at it. I let it vacuum for about 30 mins before I shut it off. It did suck up a lot of dirt, 
so comparable suction power to my Dyson. It had some difficulty finding then connecting to its home base.
One thing I don't like is that it needs to be plugged in and sitting next to an outlet. I have a small old house with few outlets and I just don't have 
the space to let it sit out. Overall- meh for me but probably a much better solution for someone with a more minimalist space.
