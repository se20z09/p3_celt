My cat is also vision challenged! 
The Taco Cat was a feral baby I found at four weeks old abandoned by her mom and needed a home. 
She was not going to stay and I was only going to keep her long enough to rehome so naturally we just celebrated her fourth birthday. 
Anyways, one of the big factors is she has birth defects leading to eye deformities and the Taco Cat doesn't see too well and will see double. 
(She is fixed on an object, bats and totally misses at times. Coincidentally her favorite toy is' circle ball track' because the toy only goes in one spot and she can't miss.) 
I don't think the fact her eyes are varying degrees of cross-eyed and squinty helps. It's uneven. She looks silly. It's cute, though.
So, anyways the other morning the puppy had to pee at like 6AM and she snuck out during the half-asleep trip to take the new puppy potty and was in the yard and had two people trying to chase her back inside. 
They were chasing her over the yard and trying to herd her back to the open screen door. 
Finally call me around 7AM to tell me my cat is outside and they've not gotten her back in after an hour and want help wrangling my cat.
I get my pajamas on and head down and stand in the yard with robe and slippers and she's in the back corner under a tree. 
Right about the spot I captured her as a baby, actually. 
I'm awake at 7AM on my day off because of her. Very sternly I just made eye contact and looked at her. "Miss Taco Cat."
She got up and slunk right back in the house, much to the annoyance of the failed cat wranglers who she evaded for an hour. 
Gave up and went back in once I came down to tell her to go back in.
