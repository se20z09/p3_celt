OK I’ve written several reviews in the past on products that I have received but this particular phone holder had me saying to myself 
which said it all “WOW!!!!!” I have tried several cell phone holders that fit onto the vent, onto the dash board etc. but this one honestly 
and truly beats all of them. It has its own self adjustment to wear the back of the holder slides in between the vent fins whether they are 
horizontal and/or vertical and are tightened up quite easily and remain in one place.Now for the phone holder itself, it has a pushbutton 
behind the base extremely accessible to where you push it and it opens up the side arms to allow you to set the phone in without fumbling and
trying to force the phone in between the two side holders. Now for the phone holder itself, it has a push button behind the base extremely accessible

This holder is so sturdy and firm that I can’t wait to put my phone into it!!! Finally finally finally I found in my personal opinion to date a 
high-quality cell phone holder for the vent in your vehicle. I can tell you that I have spent a few dollars on several various types of phone holders 
within the last six months.
