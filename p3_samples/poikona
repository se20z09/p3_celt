After rolling out several new features ahead of the 2020 presidential election designed to make it harder for users to retweet and quote tweets containing “misleading information,” 
Twitter may now be gearing up to similarly hinder users’ attempts to ‘like’ content with the same designation.

The new feature was first reported on Monday by Jane Manchun Wong, a Hong Kong-based software engineer notorious for reverse-engineering popular apps like TikTok and Instagram in order to preview new features while they’re still being tested. 
A screenshot of the new feature posted by Wong shows a prompt that pops up after a user attempts to hit ‘like’ on a disputed tweet, encouraging them to “help keep Twitter a place for reliable info,” and inviting them to “find out more” before liking.
