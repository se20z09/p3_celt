# Group 9 Project 3 Report

## Project Description
C.E.L.T is a sentiment analyzer with the goal of accurately predicting a user's sentiment by analyzing data provided over many different input sources (text and audio). The project is designed with open source in mind and makes use of the MIT license. This application is practical and is an easily testable project.

## Testing Methodology
The objective of project 3 is to test and evaluate C.E.L.T sentiment analyzer platform. This is accomplished by comparing the results obtained from the C.E.L.T platform with results obtained from human participants and a Generic Sentiment Analysis API. As a part of the testing phase we created a Google Sheet where 10 volunteers could sign up with their preferred time slots to participate in our project testing phase.
### Testing Protocol
The [Testing Protocol](Group%209%20-%20Testing%20Protocol.pdf) delineates the testing guidelines that were used to carry out this experiment.  
- A pool of 15 text samples of varying length, genre and text complexity were collected for participants to judge. The order of sample presentation was randomized for each participant.
- Participants were presented with Google assessment forms and asked to read through each text sample and provide a 100% emotional polarity rating for each text sample.
- For each participant we noted the time taken to complete the sentiment scores for all text samples. For a subset of participants, the time taken to complete individual sentiment scores was recorded. 
- Each text sample was passed C.E.L.T sentiment analyzer platform for scoring, which is recorded in the test data.
- Each text sample was also passed to a 3rd party generic sentiment analyzer to obtain emotional polarity rating, which is recorded in the test data.
- We then perform analytics on the test data to evaluate the efficacy of the C.E.L.T sentiment analyzer platform. 

## Materials
- Zoom for setting up the meetings and for participants to share their screens.
- A Google Sheet for signing up for project participation.
Google assessment form each candidate to provide 100% emotional polarity rating for 15 chosen text extracts.
- Google Evaluation sheet to note evaluation time for each candidate.
- C.E.L.T web based sentiment analyzer to assess sentime score for 15 sample texts.
- Generic sentiment analyzer [API](https://app.monkeylearn.com/main/classifiers/cl_pi3C7JiL/) to obtain emotional polarity rating for 15 sample text.
